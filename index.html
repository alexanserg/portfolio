        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Having moved around quite a bit, I found Portland is my favorite place. <strong>Few places</strong> can compete with the outdoor activities available here, or the amenities available in the city.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The Duckhouse</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This is one of the finest chinese restaurants I personally have had the opportunity to experience.  There is a soup there called "Bamboo Fungus Soup." I didn't even know that was a thing, untill I had it here, and it is delicious.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>K-Town</li>
                <img src="img/koreanbbq.jpg" alt="korean bbq picture">
                <ul>
                  <li>Korean BBQ is quickly becoming very popular, and they do it right at K-Town. The meat selection is great, and their variety of panchan (or side dishes) is hard to beat.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Angel Food & Fun</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This small mexican restaurant has a variety of dishes that are far from the standard tacos and burritos. The Cochinita de Pabil is good enough to give you goosebumbs</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Fishing</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Crab fishing on the oregon coast.</li>
                  <img src="img/crab.jpg" alt="picture of a dungeness crab">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Few kinds of fishing offer even beginners the opportunity to catch their daily limit. With the daily limit being 12 dungeness crab and 24 red rock crab, a $10 daily license and affordable rental gear is enough to catch a delicious seafood fest and have fun while doing it. Oregons beautiful coast is not to be missed either.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Salmon and steelhead fishing</li>
                  <img src="img/steelhead.jpg" alt="steelhead picture">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Oregon is home to one of the largest salmon and steelhead runs in the country. While more challenging than crabbing it is a great way to enjoy Oregons fabulous rivers and forests. You may have many trips where you catch nothing, but you are sure to enjoy yourself never-the-less.</li>

              <h3>Camping and hiking</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Oregon is home to some 202,000 acres of wilderness. From the coast to the desert and everything in between, there are a lifetime worth of opportunities to get back to nature.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Three sisters wilderness</li>
                    <img src="img/sisters/jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                      <li>Located in the central Oregon Cascades, Sisters wilderness offers nearly unmatched pristine beauty.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Multnomah Falls</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Located in the Columbia Gorge, any trip to the Portland Area would be incomplete without visiting this stunning waterfall.</li>
